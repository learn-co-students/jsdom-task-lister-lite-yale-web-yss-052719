# debug

  tiny node.js debugging utility modelled after node core's debugging technique.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install debug
```

## Usage

 With `debug` you simply invoke the exported function to generate your debug function, passing it a name which will determine if a noop function is returned, or a decorated `console.error`, so all of the `console` [format string goodies](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console-api#consolelogobject-object) you're used to work fine. A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.

Example _app.js_:

```js
var debug = require('debug')('http')
  , http = require('http')
  , name = 'My App';

// fake app

debug('booting %s', name);

http.createServer(function(req, res){
  debug(req.method + ' ' + req.url);
  res.end('hello\n');
}).listen(3000, function(){
  debug('listening');
});

// fake worker of some kind

require('./worker');
```

Example _worker.js_:

```js
var debug = require('debug')('worker');

setInterval(function(){
  debug('doing some work');
}, 1000);
```

 The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:

  ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)

  ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)

#### Windows note

 On Windows the environment variable is set using the `set` command.

 ```cmd
 set DEBUG=*,-not_this
 ```

 Note that PowerShell using different syntax to set environment variables.

 ```cmd
 $env:DEBUG = "*,-not_this"
  ```

Then, run the program to be debugged as usual.

## Millisecond diff

  When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the "+NNNms" will show you how much time was spent between calls.

  When stdout is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:

## Conventions

 If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use ":" to separate features. For example "bodyParser" from Connect would then be "connect:bodyParser".

## Wildcards

  The `*` character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named "connect:bodyParser", "connect:compress", "connect:session", instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect:compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.

  You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a "-" character.  For example, `DEBUG=*,-connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with "connect:".

## Browser support

  Debug works in the browser as well, currently persisted by `localStorage`. Consider the situation shown below where you have `worker:a` and `worker:b`, and wish to debug both. You can enable this using `localStorage.debug`:

```js
localStorage.debug = 'worker:*'
```

And then refresh the page.

```js
a = debug('worker:a');
b = debug('worker:b');

setInterval(function(){
  a('doing some work');
}, 1000);

setInterval(function(){
  b('doing some work');
}, 1200);
```

#### Web Inspector Colors

  Colors are also enabled on "Web Inspectors" that understand the `%c` formatting
  option. These are WebKit web inspectors, Firefox ([since version
  31](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/editable-box-model-multiple-selection-sublime-text-keys-much-more-firefox-developer-tools-episode-31/))
  and the Firebug plugin for Firefox (any version).

  Colored output looks something like:
